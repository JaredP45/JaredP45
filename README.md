ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JaredP45 (or just Jared), and I'm a student studying for an AAS in Software Development at Butler Community College. I graduate in May of 2022, and I plan to continue my education at Kansas State University for a BS in Machine Learning & Autonomous Systems. My information technology interests include server/cloud development, web development, Linux terminal and server management, and mobile application development. If you would like to collaborate with me, you can reach me at my email at ðŸ“«JPaubel@pm.meðŸ“«!
